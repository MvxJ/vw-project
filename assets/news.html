                        <p>With its “TOGETHER – Strategy 2025” future program, the Volkswagen Group is paving the way for 
                            the biggest change process in its history: the realignment of one of the best carmakers to become 
                            a globally leading provider of sustainable mobility. To achieve that, the Group will be transforming 
                            its automotive core business, and will among other things be launching a further 30-plus fully 
                            electric cars by 2025, as well as expanding battery technology and autonomous driving as new core

                            <h3>Volkswagen T-roc cabriollet</h3>
                            <p>The first convertible crossover (CUV) by Volkswagen is a comfortable means of transport for any trip,
                                be it for joyrides, in inner-city traffic or on long journeys, in sunny spring weather or torrential rain.
                                The fully automatic, electrohydraulic soft top forms the central element of the T-Roc Cabriolet.
                                It opens within nine seconds, even up to speeds of 30 kilometres per hour,
                                and should there be any rain clouds on the horizon the cutting-edge soft top takes eleven seconds to quickly close. 
                                The electromechanical lock system secures it in place. Downpours are thus reliably kept out and water can drain via 
                                the longitudinal seams of the side panels as an additional water channel.Volkswagen is not compromising safety in the T-Roc Cabriolet. 
                                The rollover protection system is located behind the rear seat head restraints. 
                                It extends within a fraction of a second in the event that defined lateral acceleration or lateral inclination values are exceeded. 
                                Occupants in the front benefit from a reinforced windscreen frame. The body’s torsional rigidity is additionally guaranteed by rear 
                                struts between the B-pillar on the left and right and the rear wheel housing as well as a double rear floor panel and lateral floor rails. 
                                The use of high-strength and ultra-high-strength as well as hot-shaped steel also boosts safety levels. A host of We Connect functions, 
                                such as the Emergency Call Service, breakdown call and online anti-theft alarm system come in handy in extreme situations.</p>

                        <h3>Technologies for drivers</h3>
                        <p>Cruise control makes long journeys safer and more comfortable by regulating your car's speed for you.
                            Our cruise control system1 works electronically to help regulate your car's speed. It reduces the stress on drivers 
                            and offers you more comfort on long journeys by keeping a constant speed. It's particularly effective when you have to 
                            stay within speed limits for a long way - when driving through miles of roadworks on the motorway, for example - and 
                            cuts the risk of your speed creeping up by accident.
                            The system works by memorising and maintaining the speed you select. It's very flexible, too. You can increase
                            or reduce speed manually - to a defined value - and you also have the option of returning to the speed most recently memorised.
                            The cruise control system can be turned off simply by pressing a button or by pressing the brake or clutch pedals.
                            For safety reasons, the cruise control system should not be used in heavy traffic or in difficult road conditions, such as heavy rain or ice.<br>
                            The safe-distance technology's radar sensor has a range of up to 200 metres and a beam angle of 12 degrees. The radar sensor and control unit are
                            combined into a single unit which is located - on the Passat, for example - behind the Volkswagen badge in the radiator grille.
                            Using the signals from the radar sensor, the control unit computes the distance to the vehicle ahead and your car's speed relative to it. 
                            It also works out its lateral position on multi-lane roads. If there are several vehicles within the sensor's field of coverage at the same time, 
                            this information is used to select which of the vehicles the system should track. The radar sensor is not capable of detecting stationary obstructions, 
                            such as the end of a tailback or crash barriers, however.If approaching a slower vehicle ahead or if another vehicle cuts in front of you,
                            the adaptive cruise control slows down the car by initiating corrective controls in the engine management and, if necessary,
                            in the braking system too. If the required rate of deceleration exceeds 30% of the vehicle's maximum stopping power, visual 
                            and audible warning signals will prompt the driver to apply the brakes manually.

                            <h3>Technology concept</h3>
                            <p>IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist is extremely easy to use: the standard multifunction steering wheel has a separate button 
                                for the smart assist system. A simple click is all it takes, and the new Polo assumes partly automated lateral 
                                and longitudinal guidance. The system is based on the fusion of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and adaptive lane 
                                guidance, combining for lateral and longitudinal guidance. With this combination of assist systems, the Polo 
                                takes a step into next higher vehicle classes. This is how IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist works: 
                                ACC ensures that the Polo automatically maintains the permitted speed currently selected by the driver. 
                                Thanks to camera-based Dynamic Road Sign Display, the Polo “knows” how fast it is allowed to drive. Using radar sensor 
                                technology, it also detects if a slower vehicle appears in front of it. It then brakes the Polo, and therefore always 
                                keeps the correct, safe following distance. If there are no longer any cars in front, the Volkswagen accelerates again. 
                                There will also be a predictive – forward-looking – ACC system in combination with the navigation system and dual clutch 
                                gearbox (DSG). Among other things, this will allow the vehicle to react to bends or town boundaries and reduce speed.
                                The lane keeping system Lane Assist scans the area in front of the Polo using the same camera in the windscreen as the 
                                Dynamic Road Sign Display system. The assist system thereby detects the lane markings and steers correctively as soon as 
                                any unintentional movement out of the lane is detected. If IQ.DRIVE Travel Assist is active, the predictive ACC and 
                                adaptive lane guidance work together as described. In other words, the Polo brakes, accelerates and steers automatically 
                                within the system limits. However, the driver must keep their hands on the steering wheel, as they are always responsible 
                                for judging the traffic situation and controlling vehicle behaviour. The driver signals this preparedness via the 
                                capacitive surfaces of the steering wheel rim, which respond to touch.</p>
